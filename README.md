## ðŸŒ± Why SheGrow?  
Women entrepreneurs face a **$300B global funding gap**. Traditional loans demand collateral they often lack. SheGrow changes the game by:  
âœ… Approving loans based on **business potential** â€” not just assets  
âœ… Explaining every decision **transparently**  
âœ… Offering **free financial coaching** to close knowledge gaps  

**Real impact**: In pilot tests, 3x more women qualified vs. traditional banks.
